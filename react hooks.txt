useState: Allows you to add state to your functional components, enabling them to store and manage data that can change over time.

useEffect: Enables you to perform side effects in your components, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, and subscriptions, after the component has rendered.

useContext: Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

useReducer: Offers an alternative to useState for managing more complex state logic, often used in scenarios where state transitions are more intricate.

useMemo: Helps optimize the performance of your components by memoizing the result of a computation based on its dependencies.

useCallback: Similar to useMemo, but it memoizes functions, helping to prevent unnecessary re-renders in components.

useRef: Provides a way to create mutable values that persist across renders, often used for accessing DOM elements directly or storing values that do not trigger re-renders.

useLayoutEffect: Similar to useEffect, but runs synchronously after all DOM mutations. Useful for operations that require access to the DOM immediately after an update.

useImperativeHandle: Customizes the instance value that is exposed when using ref with forwardRef.

useContext: Allows you to access context values within a component without nesting several levels of components or passing props down.

useDebugValue: Used for custom hooks to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.

These hooks provide a versatile toolkit for managing different aspects of your React applications. Depending on the complexity of your project and the specific use cases, you'll likely find yourself using a combination of these hooks to achieve your goals efficiently.
