5 Projects to Add to Your Resume:

1. To-Do List App
2. E-commerce Product Catalog
3. Weather App
4. Blog Platform
5. GitHub Repository Viewer

. Advanced State Management: Learn about more advanced state management techniques in React, such as using context, Redux, or Mobx. These tools are particularly helpful for managing state in larger applications.

2. Routing: Explore how to implement client-side routing in your React applications using libraries like React Router. This is essential for building multi-page applications within a single-page app architecture.

3. Component Composition: Dive deeper into component composition patterns. Learn how to create highly reusable and composable components that follow best practices.

4. Hooks: If you haven't already, explore more React hooks like useEffect, useContext, and custom hooks. These hooks provide powerful ways to handle side effects and manage state in functional components.

5. Styling: Investigate different approaches to styling your React components, including CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components, CSS modules, and utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

6. Testing: Learn how to write tests for your React components using testing libraries like Jest and testing utilities like React Testing Library. Testing is crucial for maintaining the quality of your codebase.

7. API Integration: Practice making HTTP requests to APIs and integrating external data into your React applications. You can use libraries like Axios or the built-in fetch API.

8. Project Building and Deployment: Explore how to build and deploy your React applications for production. This includes optimizing your build process, setting up deployment pipelines, and choosing hosting platforms.

9. Real-World Projects: Start working on real-world projects or contribute to open-source React projects to gain practical experience and apply what you've learned.
